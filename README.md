## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v16 or later)
- **Yarn** (Package Manager)
- An OpenAI API key. [Get your API key here](https://platform.openai.com/signup/).

## Running the App
Start the development server:
```bash
yarn start
```

Visit the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following:
```env
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

**Note**: Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your actual OpenAI API key.

Make sure `.env` is listed in your `.gitignore` file to prevent exposing your API key.

---

## Testing
Run unit tests with:
```bash
yarn test
```

---

## Technologies Used
- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: Adds type safety to the project.
